# About the Project:

Singapore has an ambitious goal of becoming a zero-waste nation. The amount of waste disposed of in Singapore has increased seven-fold over the last 40 years. At this rate, Semakau Landfill, Singaporeâ€™s only landfill, will run out of space by 2035. Making matters worse, Singapore has limited land for building new incineration plants or landfills.

The government would like to motivate citizens by sharing the total energy that the combined recycling efforts have saved every year. They have asked you to help them.

# Getting Started:

## 3 datasets were provided:

1. wastestats.csv
<ul>
<li><b>waste_type: </b>The type of waste recycled.</li>
    <li><b>waste_disposed_of_tonne: </b>The amount of waste that could not be recycled (in metric tonnes).</li>
    <li><b>total_waste_recycle_tonne: </b>The amount of waste that could be recycled (in metric tonnes).</li>
    <li><b>total_waste_generated: </b>The total amount of waste collected before recycling (in metric tonnes).</li>
    <li><b>recycling_rate: </b>The amount of waste recycled per tonne of waste generated.</li>
    <li><b>year: </b>The recycling year.</li><b>
</ul>
    
2. 2018_2019_waste.csv
<ul>
<li><b>Waste Type: </b>The type of waste recycled.</li>
    <li><b>Total Generated: </b>The total amount of waste collected before recycling (in thousands of metric tonnes).</li> 
    <li><b>Total Recycled: </b>The amount of waste that could be recycled. (in thousands of metric tonnes).</li>
    <li><b>Year: </b>The recycling year.</li>
</ul>
    
3. energy_saved.csv
<ul>
    <li><b>material: </b>The type of waste recycled.</li>
    <li><b>energy_saved: </b>An estimate of the energy saved (in kiloWatt hour) by recycling a metric tonne of waste.</li> 
    <li><b>crude_oil_saved: </b>An estimate of the number of barrels of oil saved by recycling a metric tonne of waste.</li>
</ul>

## Target:

Conducting the energy saved from recycled wastes from 2015 to 2019.
